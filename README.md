# totos-crystal-ball
A collection of algorithms for predicting the outcome of F1 races.

## Scope
The goal of this project is to build and deploy a collection of algorithms to predict the full finishing order, and the number of finishers for a given F1 race as reliably as possible. This is done using a combination of logistic regression and linear regression models. 

Most of the data is sourced from [this wonderful dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020) on kaggle, with additional data scrubbed from F1's website.
