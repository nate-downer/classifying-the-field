# totos-crystal-ball
A collection of algorithms for predicting the outcome of F1 races.

## Scope
The goal of this project is to build and deploy a collection of algorithms to predict the full finishing order, and the number of finishers for a given F1 race as reliably as possible. This is done using a combination of logistic regression and linear regression models.
